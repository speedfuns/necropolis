## Glitches

Noted during [LobosJR's stream](https://www.twitch.tv/lobosjr/v/77839342)

- Save and quit while opening a door will mark the door as open when you reload
- Save and quitting right before being teleported back to safe ground during a fall will put you above safe ground if located below
- Save and quitting during falls can potentially create infinite falling
